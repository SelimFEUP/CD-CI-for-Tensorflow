# Multi-step traffic prediction with TensorFlow CI/CD

This project implements a Deep Learning pipeline using LSTM for multi-step traffic flow prediction task. It includes:

- Data loading & preprocessing
- LSTM model definition
- Training & evaluation
- CI/CD using GitHub Actions
- Unit testing using `pytest`

## To Run Training

```bash
python src/train.py
