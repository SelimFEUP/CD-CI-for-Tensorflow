# Multi-step traffic prediction with TensorFlow CI/CD

This project implements a deep learning pipeline using LSTM for traffic forecasting. It includes:

- Data loading & preprocessing
- LSTM model definition
- Training & evaluation
- CI/CD using GitHub Actions
- Unit testing using `pytest`

## To Run Training

```bash
python3 src/train.py

## To Run Test
pytest tests/
